### The projects goal
The goal of the project is to create a working website. Where you are able to upload your own Portfolio and find other users portfolio's And for the three contributors to learn more about programming.

### Introduction
Would you like a website where you could sign up and create your own portfolio or look for people who are actively searching for a job then our portfolio App is just the place for you. 
Now about why we as developers wanted to make such a website. First of all we created this website together to learn about new programming languages as a starting point to our school course. Second of all this was our first assignment given by the school.

### Technology 
Our created Web Application contains these 5 programming languages for the front-end we started off with HTML and CSS, then we went over to the database creation and used mySQL. With completion of the database we could go over and use SQL and PHP together to display the data and use the PHP for the back-end as well. There are also some little pieces off Javascript used in our Web Application.
The version of the programming languages include PHP 8.2, HTML 5, MySQL, CSS and Javascript.

### The start of our project
We started off with creating a github repo where we could push, pull, commit etc to together. Then we started off creating a wireframe brainstorming about how and wehre everything should be placed. After that it started with dividing different aspects of the project to a specific person. We all started working on our tasks after that. Now we had a week off from school starting off Rick (b) and Rick (s) where working a lot in the beginning later on all three of us started calls in discord to work on the project together this is when the back-end programming started. as for now we are nearing the end of the development.

### Sources 
We all searched up things that conflicted us during programming. For example Rick doesn't really have a lot of experience in programming the back-end. But he has invested himself to the back-end and learnt a lot of it through various sources on the internet. This goes for all the members who contributed to this project we asked each other and the internet if it wasn't working out.

Rick (s) also helped me a lot with some little pieces of the back-end as for Rick (b) his friend helped him a lot with our project.
